A libmpsse-based CLI utility to talk with OZ890 on Linux using FTDI adapters. Tested in GNU/Linux on FT2232H, should be working on any other FTDI that supports hardware I2C and other systems where libusb is present (virtually every modern operating system).

Usage: connect GNDs together, hook SCL to ADBUS0, SDA to ADBUS1 and ADBUS2, then run the program (`oz890 -h` for usage help).
